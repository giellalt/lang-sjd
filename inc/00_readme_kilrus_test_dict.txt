this is an old file of Ciprian's for testing the conversion of the Kildin-Russian dictionary into Giellatekno's dictionary XML-structure

if possible, we should try to apply the Giellatekno XML-structure on sjdrus-rdk_unicode20090924.

it seems especially important (but probably very complicated to achieve?) to convert the "linked subentries" in the original dictionary (i.e. those empty entries which are only followed by a reference to the respective main entry) into true dictionary entries (followed by grammatical info, translation, etc.)
