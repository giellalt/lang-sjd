this is the complete textbase of the Kildin-Russian dictionary after a preliminary manual conversion of different formatting tags into XML tags.

note that many elements do still not open or close with the proper tags. perhaps further structuring can be done with help of regular expression search-replace?

the present (rudimentary) XML structure is similar to the structure in the printed dictionary (Kuruƒç et al. 1985), but should ideally be converted into Giellatekno's XML-structure.

it seems especially important (but probably very complicated to achieve?) to convert the "linked subentries" in the original dictionary (i.e. those empty entries which are only followed by a reference to the respective main entry) into true dictionary entries (followed by grammatical info, translation, etc.)
