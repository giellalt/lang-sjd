# Background for the Kildin analyser

The Kildin analyser is still in its infancy.

* [The analyser can be tested here](http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/index.sjd.eng.html)

The Kildin analyser still has no lexicon, but dictionary resources are being edited.

The orthographic variant used is that of Kuruč 1985 ("Krasnyj slovar'").

The grammatical analyser is a result of rather slow joint work between Michael Rießler, 
Trond Trosterud and others during the last years.
