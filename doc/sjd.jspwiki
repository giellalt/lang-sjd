!!Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 | @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 | @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 | @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 | @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 | @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
 | @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 | @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 | @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 | @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 | @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 | @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.








!!!Kildin Saami noun inflection

"class1" = monosyllabic/non-palatalized inflection foot, str-wk, no ablaut/umlaut, palatalization in Ill.Sg
 LEXICON 1DA  is orthographic subclass with xx--> x



 LEXICON 1DB  is orthographic subclass with xy-->x and "half-palatalization" in Ill.Sg;
OBS! SgIllSufJE vs. SgIllSufHalfE does not mark a true morphological subclass, but is due to orthographic conventions



Lexica 2D etc are classes from Kuruch dictionary.
It is unclear whether this is the correct classification

 LEXICON 2D  like 1D ?  these are just dummy for the moment


 LEXICON 3D 


 LEXICON 4D   is contract


 LEXICON 4DА  


 LEXICON 5D   goes to 1DA

 LEXICON OAHPA_N   is all the words from OAHPA_N, we just point them to 1DA.

 LEXICON ELAN_N   is all the words from ELAN_N, we just point them to 1DA.

!!ELAN dump
These words are added during testing work with the ELAN-FST script
They should be given correct declension classes later

!!Oahpa dump
These words are added from sjdoahpa.
Some of them are unfortunaely plural forms, and should be removed 
or put in singular.
Then they should be given correct declension class
