Kildin dictonaries work for Ciprian (deadline 13.09.2010):

 - compile sjd<->rus dictionaries for the lightweight dictionary lookup solution
   (see http://victorio.uit.no/webdict/index.html)
 - if it works, this would be THE solution for a very simple 'broadband' dictionary client
   for working offline (using Apertium dictionary tools)
 - Cip is downloading, installing, and testing the lighweight dict on 
   the following browsers on the virtual Windows XP:
   - Internet Explorer
   - Mozilla Firefox
   - Opera
   - Google Chrome
   - Safari

Todo: the same tests with the same browsers on MacOS and Linux
