	Abstract = {Rogier Blokland and Cornelius Hasselblatt (``The endangered Uralic
languages'') survey the Uralic language family (Finno-Ugrik plus three
Samoyedic languages), mentioning several languages that have died out
in the last 1000 years, leaving approximately 30 living ones
today. They note that Russian-speakers' denigration of local languages
still causes many Uralic speakers to be ashamed of their own
language. The large state languages Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian
are not endangered. The authors spend the bulk of the paper discussing
five ``medium-size'' languages which have some official status and are
potentially endangered, six smaller languages which are more
endangered, and six ``minor'' languages which are in the process of
vanishing. For each of these they talk about political and social
status, the where and who of language use, its function in higher
education, text production and age of the written tradition. Most are
not yet seriously endangered, but 4 are moribund. They note that
social welfare systems are a two-edged sword: a lack of a system can
mean less pressure to conform to a dominant language, but the presence
of a system can support the maintenance of a language as well.
