- ELAR

A. MPI-tools:

1. Annex/Trova: "the Annotation Exploration tool in the MPI web-based framework for archive exploration and enrichement" - see IMDI-Browser!!

2. Arbil: "IMDI Metadata Editor, Browser & Organizer Tool" only offline, thus only for locally-stored data; search function not yet integrated

3. IMDI-Browser: search entire MPI corpus collection (DoBeS + many more):
	* in "metadata" fields (in the DoBeS sense of cataloging metadata)
	* in "annotation" fields, including display of all hits within context and links to web-based display of ELAN file in ANNEX, inludes list of 8 words on either side of hit, very complex context search using web-based TROVA annotation search; search results can be downloaded/saved

4. Lexus - can be searched (for lexical items, dictionaries) - only available online

5. ELAN: elaborate searching, including using regular expressions, within a single ELAN file or across several files, including multiple layer search (same software/GUI as with ANNEX/TROVA); search results can be saved.


B. ELAR/HRELP: very basic character-string search (not even as advanced as a google search!) of a single project's depost only. I assume more will be possible in the future?
